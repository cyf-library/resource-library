# Resources Library

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CodeYourFuture/resource-library.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/CodeYourFuture/resource-library)

## Getting Started

- This repo is frontend and backend
- It requires NODE
- This app is built with:
  NODE.JS,
  REACT,
  POSTGRESQL

## Installing

Install project dependencies in the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Run project locally:

```sh
npm run dev -- --watch && node index.js
```

## Deployment

The following files are provided for build and deployment:

- `.travis.yml`: tells [Travis CI] how to build the front end and trigger a [Cloud Foundry](CF) deployment;
- `.cfignore`: tells CF not to include things like `node_modules/` and the `README.md`, to save sending so many files over the network when deploying; and
- `manifest.yml`: tells CF how to run the application.

Additionally a Postgres service will need to be bound to the application on CF to provide the `DATABASE_URL`; see e.g. https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/crunchy/using.html for details.
